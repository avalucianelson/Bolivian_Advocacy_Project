# üåç Behind Every Brazil Nut

Welcome to my **Brazil Nut Advocacy Project** repository! This project is part of my work as a Tech Fellow for CodePath's **Introduction to Web Development** class (WEB101), where I guide students through building websites that advocate for causes they're passionate about. Alongside the students, I build this site using the same fundamentals taught in the course (updating it each week as they learn more), serving as an example of how to create a meaningful and impactful advocacy project through web development.

## üåø Project Overview

My project focuses on building awareness about the harvesting of Brazil nuts, a process that supports thousands of Latin American families, particularly in Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil. Brazil nut harvesting is an essential livelihood for many in the Amazon rainforest region, yet it often goes unnoticed by the world. My goal is to build awareness around the uniqueness of Brazil Nut harvesting and the sacrifices that go into it. 

### üì∏ The Story Behind the Nuts

The website showcases the beautiful and hard work of the families who gather Brazil nuts. Through a collection of powerful photos taken by **Tyfano Peter** (check out his work at [tyfano.com](http://tyfano.com)), the site brings attention to the daily lives of these families and their deep connection to the environment. Tyfano traveled to the Amazon rainforest in Bolivia to capture the heart of this community and the dedication required to harvest Brazil nuts sustainably.

## üíª How It Relates to WEB101

This project serves as an example for my students in WEB101. In the class, each student builds a website that aligns with a cause they are passionate about. Week by week, I adjust this website as my students learn more concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This allows me to demonstrate how to apply new skills directly to an advocacy project, evolving it as we progress through the course.

If you're interested in learning more about web development or supporting this advocacy effort, please explore the repository or contact me through my GitHub profile.
